Hi <%= @giver[:name] %>!

It's that time of year again!  Christmas 🎄 <%= @year %> is right around the corner!  You are the Secret Santa for <%= @receiver[:name] %>!  As the name implies, this is a secret so please do not tell your giftee.

What does this mean?  We Norling siblings and spouses are each responsible for ONE gift for ONE sibling or spouse this year.  This email is your gifting assignment.  If you fail this task, <%= @receiver[:name] %> literally gets nothing and will have a horrible Christmas and it'll be your fault.  No pressure.  The gift exchange will take place sometime around Christmas-ish.  Maybe a few days after?  Or a few days before?  Who knows, but it'll be great!  Please be ready with your wrapped gift valued at $<%= @gift_amount %> or less.

Any further questions about this event, ask <%= @organizer['name'] %>.  But don't let her know if you're her Secret Santa.  Anyhow, she mastermind-ed this whole thing last year and can answer any questions again this year.

Cheers from your Happy Secret Santa Pairing Bot!
